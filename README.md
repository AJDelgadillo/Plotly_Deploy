# Plotly_Deploy
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to utilize plotly to create different types of charts to display biodiversity among a dataset of swabbed samples. Using plotly I created a gauge chart, horizontal bar graph, and a bubble chart. I also created a drop down menu to select for different test subject IDs to view demographic informaiton. Lastly, all elements are displayed on a dashboard.
